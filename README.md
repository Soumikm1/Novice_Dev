# A community market maintained by smart contract
I tried to implement a market using smart contracts. Wrote it in Solidity. All users interested in participating in this marketplace has to register themselves as either as a customer or a shopkeeper. All the functions are self explainatory. Customers would be paid tokens as an agreement by a specific shopkeeper. Token payment part is not yet implemented................
So, I hope you all to wait for a few days more.
