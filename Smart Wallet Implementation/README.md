# A smart wallet maintained in solidity
I tried to make a wallet using smart contracts. Wrote it in Solidity. 
## Owners and Guardians
The one who deploys the smart contract would automatically become the owner. It is highly suggested to choose 5 guardians, because if the owner loses his account, the guardians can make one among themselves the new owner. For changing ownership, 3 out of 5 guardians have to select a particular one guardian to make it the owner.
