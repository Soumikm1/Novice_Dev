# A community market maintained by smart contract
I tried to implement a market using smart contracts. Wrote it in Solidity. All users interested in participating in this marketplace has to register themselves as either as a customer or a shopkeeper. All the functions are self explainatory. Customers would be paid tokens as an agreement by a specific shopkeeper. 
Tokens are implemented by using OpenZeppelin following ERC20 standard, in the CommodityTokens contract. Each shop owner would have their own token name and symbol (Yeah, check for same naming or symboling by two different shops not implemented yet). That means each shop owner would have their own commodityTokens at separate addresses. Any single customer at a time can possess tokens from multiple shops, and can decide which one to burn. Once the Web3 app necessary for reading out the outputs are created, then it can be used to notify the respective shopowner who has burnt their coins and how many, prompting them to make delivery.
